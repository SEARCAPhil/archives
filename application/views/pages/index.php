		Document management, often referred to as <b>Document Management Systems (DMS)</b>, is the use of a computer system and software to store, manage and track electronic documents and electronic images of paper based information captured through the use of a document scanner. 

		Document management is how your organization stores, manages and tracks its electronic documents.

Also, the processes used to track, store and control documents.<small><em>Source :</em><a href="http://www.aiim.org/What-Is-Document-Imaging">www.aiiim.org</a></small>
